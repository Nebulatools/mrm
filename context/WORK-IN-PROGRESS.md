# Work In Progress

## Objective
Confirm the dashboard summary payload contract remains unchanged and communicate readiness to the frontend.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Existing dashboard summary API(s) return identical JSON shape (fields, types, required/optional) compared to current baseline.
- [ ] No breaking path changes; confirmed current FE calls still resolve successfully.
- [ ] Document confirmation on the Issue with a short note and sample payload.
- [ ] Provide stable sample/seed or captured payload for QA/FE to validate visuals.

## Assumptions
- No backend logic changes are required for this UI refresh.
- No DB/schema or service contract changes; only verification/communication.
- Any feature flags are UI-only; backend behavior is not gated.

## Tasks
- [ ] Confirm dashboard summary payload remains unchanged and communicate readiness to FE (S)

## Risks
- Undocumented FE reliance on field ordering or optional fields could surface after release.
- Divergence between staging and production payloads if feature flags or data sources differ.
